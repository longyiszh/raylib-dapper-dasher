# Raylib Dapper Dasher

Dapper Dasher is a runner game where the character dashes out of the way of flying hazards!

(Which is based on [RayLib][raylib])

Forked from [Raylib VSCode Template by GameDev.tv][RaylibVSCodeTemplate]

## Play through

You play as the character Scarfy dashing on the night street.

Your object is to avoid all the floating hazards ahead.

You win when the last nebula hazard is successfully avoided, and you lose when you collide with any hazard.

Honestly I don't know much about C++ right now, but you just open with VSCode and hit `F5`, so you can play the game.
